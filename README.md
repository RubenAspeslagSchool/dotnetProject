## known bugs
### blazor
The buttons are not calling the onclick funtions, and the form-binding only work to put the deafauld values in the form, but they are not overwritten by the input of the user upon form submitions, the forms are being done, but it only submits the deafauld values of the viewmodel, and not what the user filled in.
